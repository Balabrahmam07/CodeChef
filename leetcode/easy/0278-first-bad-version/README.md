# First Bad Version

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2,..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1

```py
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        left = 1
        right = n
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left+right) // 2
            if isBadVersion(mid):
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
        
```
